Replace the entire page by a crisp, beautiful, shadcn-based page at live.divizend.com. It should use the Divizend logo from https://divizend.com/divizend.svg

It should use vibrant colors and patterns which illustrate aliveness, life, nourishment and global flourishing, bridging the gap between certain artistic parts and some more efficient, concise, almost strictly joyful.

All text it has should always be beautifully displayed in a bilingual way, i.e. on the same page there should be German text as the primary, and English text directly associated with it as secondary.

I will give you a list of sections to include on the web page you should generate. Make sure to make the corresponding German text as accurate translations as possible.

Decide on the heading for me, based on the rest of the content. Also decide on the subheading for me as well as the abstract. Display all of it in a concisely beautiful, almost article-like section. Style it appropriately.

After that, as the first main section, present a section on "Divizend – The Participatory Startup". With the launch of its community branch, Divizend launches a visionary new product: The Visionary.

Present this section like a 1980s Apple Commercial: The Visionary leverages AI to enable you to achieve your financial goals more effectively. Present this like the parts included in the product:
- Open first questions for an easy start;
- Balancing 10 base categories of: visions, reality, motivation, emotions, knowledge, values, interests, security, independence, habits + infinitely more
- (come up with some more related to insights, goals, context and subgoals, which can even be automatically created recursively)

In this section, at the bottom, clearly show: And how much does it cost? And then: "€19.99/month", but that crossed out as if it was reduced to "€9.99/month", but marked like an "Unverbindliche Preisempfehlung", with UVP also marked there (as if it would be a super meaningful and revolutionary Apple announcement). Free and open source on GitHub. Then add the GitHub link: https://github.com/divizend/companion, as well as a badge with the number of GitHub stars of that repository.

Then have a section on what this "Unverbindliche Preisempfehlung" means and visualize this:
- It means that we, as a business, make a recommendation to *you* what to pay.
- In the Divizend Companion, the "mother app" of the Visionary, you can also choose lower prices, based on necessity. We know that €19.99/month is not a high price, but for some it is still too high. Using a first-come-first-served-based waiting list system, we allow everyone to participate by offering prices as low as €0.99, based on the intentional sponsorship of those voluntarily paying a higher price. Paying more or less doesn't change the feature set someone receives, which is by design.

TODO: FASTER, 

Finally announce the founding of the 1st International Day of Financial Flourishing, an Unconference-style event (with linking to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference) taking place on the 1st of April, 2025, live on https://twitch.tv/divizend. 

Then have a section which is like a feature list. Only have two columns: the feature name and "Divizend Companion". In the Divizend Companion column, there should always be a checkmark. The rows should be:
- 

In the footer, put "A Hermes' Loom initiative endeavour." (in small text), with Hermes' Loom in bold and linking to https://hermesloom.org
